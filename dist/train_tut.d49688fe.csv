 re considering  st paragraph edit  i don t understand the reasons for  s recent edit of this article  not that i m sure that the data are necessarily wrong  rather  i m persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject i note that articles about other sitting justices have been similarly enhanced and i also believe those changes are no improvement  in support of my view that this edit should be reverted  i would invite anyone to re visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists a benjamin cardozo  a learned hand b john marshall harlan  b john marshall harlan ii  the question becomes  would the current version of the wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph i think not perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument kathleen sullivan of stanford law makes when she suggests that some on the harvard law faculty wonder how antonin scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging i would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point  less humorous  but an even stronger argument is the one clarence thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to yale at a minimum  i m questioning this edit it deserves to be reconsidered  ,000cfee90f50d471,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 bi  you said you wanted to talk  at the bottom of the lead section you have written its promoter speculated in that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator  but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials regarding in addition  the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials that statement appears to come from ref on page the full quote is if the mass of the tether alone started to exceed times the mass of the payload  then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials  although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures  it then goes on to say as we shall see  presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the hastol tethers needed  the primary message we want to leave with the reader is we don t need magic materials like buckminster fuller carbon nanotubes to make the space tether facility for a hastol system  existing materials will do  so it would appear that you misread your reference the tether mass of times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem systems where the tether mass is less than times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials  to further reinforce this the conclusion to the report states the fundamental conclusion of the phase i hastol study effort is that the concept is technically feasible  we have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting  spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the earth into earth orbit  for more than one hastol architecture concept  we have developed a design solution using existing  or near term technologies  we expect that a number of the other hastol architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies  the systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of earth to orbit space access  regarding but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts  and a boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that in general  the non spinning tether hyperskyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts the full quote is hyperskyhook  in zubrin proposed the hypersonic skyhook as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers  since the orbital speed of the space tether decreases with increasing altitu,001d8e7be417776a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 is it scientific to attribute an event a  to cause b  where cause b was deliberate designed  with some sort of intelligent intent  don t answer the questions beyond that well  the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged  there are several major fundamental problems here  first  you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind id is quite literally not of this earth  natural science might look at a honeycomb  see it is built by bees  and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb  and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees  that is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth  id has at its core the notion that something outside the system we can observe is at cause here  this is not science in any sense of the word  it is mythology  when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox  they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes  no evidence of paul and his ox remain  i mean  really  second  natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable  theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up  id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally  how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria  if you don t understand it  you can t do statistics on it  id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn t have a complete  detailed  natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well  it s so improbable for this to happen  that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science  you can assign probabilities to something you don t understand  id is just making up their numbers  finally  your example has a  b  where b was deliberate design  that s all well and good for a rigged example  except that with respect to life on earth  b is unknown  your a  b example might qualify as forensic science  if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart  you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart  the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart  you can probably figure that s what killed him  you don t have that with life on earth  you have one scenario  a and you have no other cases to observe or test  so  in that sense  a  b is not scientific if you ve never actually observed b btw  b is teh intelligent designer  which has never been observed so  in that sense  no  it isn t science  ,0033b9d5ccd499fb,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however  the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate  invertebrates  radiolarians  sponges  plants  pollen  foot prints  etc and multiple processes may include permineralization  recrystalization  carbonization  replacement  dissolving  diagenesis  etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue  however quick burial is not questioned the major question is  how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab  which of course implies that given the right conditions  vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood  but rather that there has been some years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet  how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with ,004b975fabbbffa9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

ahh  hello witzeman symbols m m characters greek cyrillic ipa  t d my famous article witze  happiness wikipedia the witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families  regardless of race  age  character or knowledge  the outside world knows little about these elusive characters  and the honour of the witzeman  for those who have ever been a witzeman  it has been said to have been a great honour  although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed  a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years  until they are called by former witzemans via dreams  associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman the present witzeman is an year old boy namely benjamin woods  who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this  awesome radiance in his top right bumcheek he has not told a great number of people his testimony  but has promised to do so in years to come  history the present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the witzeman in present years  because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour  to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time  the term  witzeman  is a compound word of the adjective witze and  man witze being an th century term for  a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence unfortuneatly  witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind  for unspeakable reasons  proper history as early as the th century  witzemen were considered outcasts  and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks  this led to the  st witzeman rebellion of when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team  this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman  as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced  gaga  at a government meeting that year  the period from here to the early s was a dark time in the witzemans history  however good times were to come for the witzeman  many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the s  building up to a great moment in the history the great rebellion of this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons  wearing clown masks  but otherwise completely naked  this was thought to be an act of circambulation  however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour  were  mentally  spiritually  and emotionaly scarred for life this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability  suffering from trauma  it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman  in a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed  stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased  although this was a formal agreement  many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman  as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted ,00510c3d06745849,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 attributing and classifying of personalities invitation  your input to culture of lithuania is welcomed some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well known ideological systems may raise here  i propose a quite liberal variant of it  where definition may not be connected with one certain word  necessity however to follow certain classifying remains  my initial ideas on this branch  the ones  concerning period of lithuanian national renaissance period  some artists  writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists  this definition is not false  but some more concrete things should be added  some specifics of lithuania we should distinguish leading ideas of the nat  renaissance from later modernism  which is more known for us  cultural aspirations of the later nat  ren  may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of lithuania  but they accented also expression of lithuanian cultural heritage  and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  lithuanian  i mean  that such authors in as iurlionis is seen as modernist in lithuanian context  but it also  and even more  is a representative of lithuanian culture  when in european or world wide context  a parallel  example may be taken from literature of india  poet  tagore  well known nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of india  making india more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to western culture  but in his own country  he was seen as a modernist too  who was changing traditional cultural forms  especially stagnated ones  this way also lithuanian cultural leaders of the n  ren  could be seen as modernists  which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones  in lithuanian context  they also can be seen as modernists in a wider context  but more for acquainting western people with lithuanian culture than for their direct input into western culture  iurlionis is the best example here in other way  the later lithuanian modernists  they depended mostly to later  generation  approximately from  th decade of the th century  concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose  looking generally  was  to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life  see the table below we see two different movements and two different world outlooks here  the problem is  that both movements collaborated  especially their political wings did  and interchange of ideas between them is well seen  so  many researchers don t pay attention to this difference  especially in the soviet period  when national ideas were officially forbidden  mixture in description of these movements was allowed  e  g  philosopher ram  nas bytautas  who clearly depends to the first generation  is often described as liberal  and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation  as idea of liberalism period and generation  artists  writers  philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period  the younger generation  approx painter and composer iurlionis  painter kazys imonis  poet and philosopher vilius storastas vyd  nas  dramatist sofija kymantait iurlionien poets adomas jak  tas  motiejus gustaitis  liudas gira  composer stasys imkus  philosopher ram  nas bytautas reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture  almost unknown before them  the period between wwi and wwii and post war years  poets v mykolaitis putinas  kazys binkis  writer ignas einius jurk  nas  artists  all  ars  group philosopher juozas girnius  modernists  introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life  central european modernism note  lists of personalities isn t complete here  nor it s made precisely by prominence jul utc ,0063a8786a7034fc,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 randroide answers to next step guys  i do not see you taking steps to wikipedia requests for mediation i can not do this job because i always connect from filtered institutional net access  and following those steps could result in new  undesired  controversial truncation of words by the software  i do not want that happenning could you please follow the instructions in the link i provided thank you  randroide answers to new reference by burgas at last we agree on something  of course that the new section is a good idea  the false suicidal terrorists from prisa will also be included there  come on  boys  start writing that section  i do not want all the kudos for myself  the new proposed article is  by now  an effort made only by me  but remember  npov and sources  all the sources  just like me citing el pa  s in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the th bomb  cheers indeed  a good point  and all the remarks in cope too  and the moral certitudes of mariano rajoy published in el mundo  i agree with you larean  what randroide omits to mention on the section about the th bomb is that he only added balancing references when i insisted that he do so  the original version he created was entirely pov  as is much of the rest of the proposed article  also  all the sources that he added from el pais are only available to subscribers npov it is not  you are right  southofwatford  in your randroide omits  section if you have not subscription to el pa  s i am sorry but that  s your problem  my institutional access also has some advantages  like paid access to el pa  s and many  many other publications and books that  s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered internet acces  it  s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources do you see the truncation of words is offsett  i think  by better sources btw  if you write under a randroide answers section you are  invading my space  i do not mind  really  but you are doing it  risking new truncations on your messages  to avoid this  please write outside randroide answers sections if you think that the proposed article is pov  work in it to make it npov  the article is not mine i ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here  it s very short  the issue is not whether i subscribe to el pa  s  its whether the people who read an article in the english wikipedia subscribe to it  all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is npov is  to my mind  completely unreasonable  all sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  very funny  southofwatford  i am going to follow this joke of yours please propose also the deletion of all books as sources  because  did you know there is always someone without this or that book  delete all references to tv or radio stations  because that user in brazil has no tv and no radio at home  delete all the references in spanish  because  did you know there are users who know no spanish it  s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes  really  i had a good laugh user southofwatford  how strange that you should find it so funny  after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced  so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny  it s simply bizarre  equally  in the english wikipedia i would argue that choosing a spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in english does not make sense  except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing your cynicism is evident in your response ,008a1e9c45de8138,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 s rant  presently  we are witnessing  an open war against croatian dinaric culture croatian left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural even fashist being  in  service of conservative hdz party  croatian writer predrag raos  for instance  performed on gusle instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year with only one intention to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition  another apostle of croatian left miljenko jergovi refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players some even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda  all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however  croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian  dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture  for example  the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music  marko kraljevi is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovi s book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje also  the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik even now  a contemporary croatian writer  born in dubrovnik  stijepo mijovi ko  an tells us a story about his uncle  also from dubrovnik area  who could memorize numerous gusle songs  stijepo mijovi ko  an  gusle  glasnik  may p dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin  born kalafatovi a daughter of famous gusle player ante  although illiterate  she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs  some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry  not far from dubrovnik  another coastal city makarska was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music  actually  this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players  this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija ka  i mio  i th century catholic priest who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond  to honour ka  i s work  ivan me  trovi the most famous croatian sculptor  built a sculpture in america showing ka  i in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument  in addition to ka  i makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music  according to dr  fra karlo juri  i who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banovi zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovi kudri and culminating with the most known mate banovi trli as for dalmatian women  they didn t play gusle  it s considered a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound  olinko delorko  the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the s  states in his book ljuba ivanova that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women  especially the ones from the island of hvar  the zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition  english writer maude m  holbach  travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century  states in her book dalmatia  the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region  as for dinaric dances  which took place at markets and certain festivals  they  are very picturesque and interesting  and worth going a long way to see  being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe  p this admiration for dinaric folk music  particularly gusle  was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland matija murko  the researcher of this literary music forms had reported that during his trips  through dalmatia in the s  he saw a child  barely three years old playing gusle  eduard osrede  ki hrvatske narodne juna  ke pjesme eljezno be p now  lets  take a look at  the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations  hajduk  junak  gusar  alkar  uskok  sinjska alka  etc  what do they have in common  of course  their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region  having this in mind  one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct why do we have so few gusle players today is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock  n  roll  culture if so  why has tamburitza music of northern croatia  gained wide acceptance from the croatian establishment while its  dinaric counterpart  gusle music  is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre,00ced92ee28c7ee8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

in history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view  in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view  since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian  historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity  while theology makes no such claims  it is true that there are millions who believe that jedp was birthed in hell  or would believe it if they knew what jedp means so in principle their view is notable  but as enns said  it is a fringe view in the academe  even among scholars who actually disagree with jedp  the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources  therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia  while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wp undue  this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong  wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view  of course  this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties  since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers  us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes  so  in a sense  scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions  only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism  they are free to do this  but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians ,0141bcdf68c13b91,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

while i agree that indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation  the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying second there is no proof at all that the mighty sarasvati of the rigveda was in fact this  now dry  river  the identification is itself open to doubt apart from there being facts proof to indicate that saraswati did exist as this dry river including geological facts as to why it dried up  the evidence also points to the fact that it was not a tributary of the indus  refuting point of the passage quoted above and in fact drew the waters of the sutlej and the yamuna to be a river system of it s own  and though a large number of sites have been found along this river system  none of them are of the scale of harrapa mohenjodaro  leaving the indus valley tag as the correct one  saraswati did exist today the timing is disputed and not the existence  wheter it is vedic and indic vs harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than it s existence ,0160715720eed9ce,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 tim  firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline  and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour  yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in  there is clearly a massive diffence between  say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions  or between the chinese and u s  jurisdictions  since the legal and regulatory systems are very different  as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets  beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in  say  paris or toulouse  even though they are both in the same jurisdiction  i appreciate that the situation in the u s  is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions  even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though  to give an example  the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market  but it will also have a quite different profile on the whole a lot more specialist  niche and focused on high tech  to give another example  in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn t have an office in london  even if it had offices in every other big city  in fact all of the very top tier uk firms  dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them  despite its size  have just one uk office  in london  although they have other offices overseas  saying that dla has has offices across the united states  egypt  south africa  kenya  thailand  china would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader  we could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesary element of vagueness  imprecision and even original research  i do accept that dla  with offices  is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article  however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it  and should be included as much as possible  ,01726bfc7b29b8c9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 nope  i didn t read the guide to appealing  didn t have time  the user in question is engaged in harassment  i ve been doing this long enough to know and i can prove it  he she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page  reverted the article while i was in the midst of editing it  my second pass  couldn t even preview changes then changed his her mind as to my real wiki sin  since the onus for proving the doris day available as pd on archive org was on him her not me and the usual span for pre bern had expired long ago decided my real sin was original research  oh noes and continued to revert based on that  does or add clutter  sure it can  but if the user in question was really concerned about that  about the quality of the article and about extraneous details  why didn t he she even notice two paragraphs already there  comprising about of the entire article  dealt with norman schwarzkopf  an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name  i ll tell you why  the user wasn t engaged in good faith goodwill editing and the normal back and forth that leads to better articles  he she was involved in blocking input to the article  why  was it personal against me  or was it to preserve the existing content of the article  including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand  i can only speculate  but i d guess it s some sort of power trip and wiki bullying  i don t really have time for this  i have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn t directly related to content and improving articles  i could pretend this user didn t do what he she did  but i m wasting my own time here and i don t really have a stake in any such pretense  i don t have any stake in improving this article either  no dog in the race  i just see how it can be improved and made more informative  as a long term wikipedia user and editor  i don t see any problem in jumping in and fixing something  i almost expect some sort of pushback now  but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on target in very minor stub like articles  the problem isn t me here  it s that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior  and they are getting away with it  wikipedia becomes a much poorer place  a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share  also  i don t recal ever having called him her a bot  i think you put those words in my mouth  perhaps inadvertently  his her behavior is malicious  but probably not malware  just the normal human collection of problems  i think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper  he she isn t quite qualified for that at this point anyway  and it s having a very chilling effect across wikipedia  i won t egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms  i will continue to write in english  and to read articles on wikipedia in english  and to think of ways to improve them in english  i am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here  and most of the rest of the wikijargon  nothing new under the sun here  if you read the edits i made carefully  and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user  you will see i m not off the mark here at all  i know what s going on  i don t know why  but i don t have to  and i expect the motivations aren t interesting  respond if you have anything to say  ,01754d101f511048,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 question on possible citation i m sorry if i missed your question i don t pay much attention to that page  in response to your question  let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation  the job of wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view i haven t yet worked in no original research wp nor says that we mustn t integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions  comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research  we can integrate information  so long as we don t arrive at new theories  another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy  the more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate  getting down to details  the predators and editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source  the bauer site  even if somewhat unreliable  may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about bauer  i m not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct  however i would say that your proposed text appears reasonable  the sources are sufficient  and no original conclusions are made  the website takedown issue is confusing to me  but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources  overall  my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better  attack articles are not encouraged  while we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldn t enlarge the warts  nor ignore their better features  balance is a part of npov but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources  there no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war  it is alleged the website takdown was instigated by bauer  it isn t clear if she did  and other factors between the forum and the ip are not known  it was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs  i don t see how that can be objective  bauer  i m sorry i did not get back to you about the usenet stuff et al but i ve been somewhat overloaded at work  personally  i think the article is better now than when i first saw it  thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn t seem like a lynch mob  y all are doing a good job  and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted i m glad to help and try and make the article neater  and i don t mean to sound brusque in the summary field  but there was a lot to cram in there  thanks for the note  i appreciate it  i would say karen saying i ve called her names is an out and out fabrication  i ve never done any such thing  or whether it s because he s been able to insult me and call me names on wikipedia  repeatedly and without consequences i ve accused her and jule of carrying the water for tnh and absolutewrite and they have  that isn t namecalling by a long stretch  i m really weary of these attacks over this  this is mob rule  while avi seems genuine  she s hanging with a tough insulting tribe  the threats against me are real and escalating by the hour  blaming me won t make my points any less valid  nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd  it s the internet equivalent of stoning  this is not a fabrication  i get awfully tired of being called a troll  or part of a mob or cult or group troll  or a self interested partisan  or a blog comment commando  or other things i could point at if i wanted to depress myself  you also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy  fat and ugly  putting the word if in front of it doesn t make it any less of an insult  i ve tried to be polite to you  and will continue to do so  but this is the response  and  please notice  like abi  avi is avraham the admin  abi the ml commenter who believes in kindness  i counseled against piling on  talk contribs those are not ad hominem names karen  yet you ve linked to a thread where you and teresa caled me a psycho  you should hear what she said in private when i asked not to be spoken of negatively in threads on making light  it s obvious you two are pro tnh and absolutewrite  that s self interest and backed up by the fact that you run to her for counseling  well  avi can make her own decisons about it then can t sh,018aab4d87d613d3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 philosopher rfc  philosopher  from wiktionary a person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy i am going to make the case that we must call stefan molyneux a philosopher without qualifiers  in the lead this is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy  only that it is his career note  not all of the sources i use below are in the article at present  the point here is to first convince rfc respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted  then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place  definitions  obviously  each source is going to use slightly different phrasing  some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy but i think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent  using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political  ethical  and theistic specializations in one word  which we then elaborate on later in the article  philosophical conversation philosophy show used to describe his freedomain radio series libertarian libertarian thinker libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies anarcho capitalist anarcho capitalism is a political philosophy  voluntaryist voluntaryism  or sometimes voluntarism is a libertarian philosophy  athiest arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches  ethics  ethics  sometimes known as philosophical ethics  ethical theory  moral theory  and moral philosophy  is a branch of philosophy secular ethics  secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy  primary source  as stefan molyneux is a living person  we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him  obviously  we don t want to host any sort of fringe claims if we are to dispute what he says about himself  though  then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this  or we open wikipedia to discredit or liability this is why blps are held to strong standards in the first place  i think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct  he is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media  which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the old school philosophers we re used to  freedomain radio about page my master s thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies i have been fascinated by philosophy particularly moral theories since my mid teens  i left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at freedomain radio  i have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy  freedomain radio  the show that molyneux hosts  has the tagline the largest and most popular philosophical conversation in the world molyneux s books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy  particularly universally preferable behaviour  upb a rational proof of secular ethics and against the gods  a concise guide to atheism and agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies strong atheism  the case for evacuating the middle ground article  why i am a philosopher  video a response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy  an introduction to philosophy part video course produced by molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts  reality  knowledge  truth  gods religion  ethics  and politics unsolvable philosophical questions solved  video tackles great philosophical questions considered unanswerable  proofs for god destroyed by a philosophical atheist video a philosophical review discusses the major philosophical  political  economic and social developments of video https w youtube com watch v udlsgjbw hs philosophy questio,01b6cca55becc58b,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 stradbroke galleon portuguese hallo moondyne  i do admit that when i signed onto wikipedia i was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge  nazi s but now that i am aware of it i will make the appropriate adjustments  i was under the obviously mistaken impression that wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts  knowledge and information  the notion that the stradbroke galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about  discussed and investigated for more than years by historians and historical groups such as the royal historical society of queensland  the maritime archaeology association of queensland and many more too numerous to include here  there exists  in various libraries  books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which i have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the wp domain  the fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions  what has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group  i e  hesperian and his friends  who are representatives of the mainstream view  hesperian complain about the media coverage i have recieved but this never appeared in any of the wp contributions i made and hesperian s mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for hesperian s antagonistic attitude  simple  old fashioned professional jealousy  thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by hesperian for personal reasons  for example the portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an aboriginal midden  identified by a spanish musuem offical and story told to me by a uq archaeology phd student is very relevant to the theory of the portuguese discovery of australia  this kind of knowledge suppression is not what wiki is about but i guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been  suck ed in by hesperian and his little band of mates  which is a pity  but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should i expect wiki be any different  still it is dissapointing  happy trails  ,01d14606bf9ea4ba,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good wikipedia on the topic ackoz suggests that  because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions  it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it i reject such a stance i think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and or controversial where many wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe wikipedia s job is to report the truth this is wrong wikipedia s job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is any attempt to do that is original research instead of truth wikipedia aims for verifiability put a different way  wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion  not our opinions but those of reliable sources if the truth is clear and uncontroversial  it is easy for us to report that if the truth is murky and controversial  it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic even if these reliable sources conflict where wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents the truth and not just one perspective  or pov  on the topic at hand i have been trying to hit this npov sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides  obviously is  because some users  jadger and wikiferdi  don t want to discuss in fact  they want us to agree with their pov  that s not discussion about the npov edits  that s why i quit from the discussion about the form of the article  talk ,01e325ea4bf0f8a3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 agreed  although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word  i was concentrating on the polish attitude here  as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand  obviously  if the article is to be written from a supra national perspective  at least the czech experience needs to be included  czechoslovakia  being the only functioning democracy in the region by the s  had closer ties with the west than poland did  and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than poland was  the west politically accepted the country s territorial mutilation  which was not the case with poland  that said  i am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as finland  the baltics  yugoslavia  or even ukraine  which had never been independent in the first place  is a good idea  while the west could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war  i think that the article s focus should be on poland and czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue  after all  there were dissidents in germany and the soviet union  too  who were harbouring grudges towards western politicians because of their appeasement policy oct utc ,01e9f5b4ae3454d8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 i think clockback that your suggested reference to ainsworth s involvement in the img is too long and that something along the lines of brief flirtation would be better  i think that the img reference needs to be short somewhere in the early career section posted after the article has been expanded a little  otherwise the article might appear weighty  i think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth but bedsides  this brief dalliance with marxism  in an overall consideration of his political career  pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of defence secretary at a time of crisis for the british army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources  this is simply not reflected at all in the ainsworth article  i tried reflecting it as follows his appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the prime minister  who considered at least three other candidates before appointing ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by off riorob above  even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in ainsworth s biography  perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found which i suspect should not be difficult that it can be re included  i want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against ainsworth  but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end  and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment actually it reflects worse on brown and the farcical reshuffle  ,020ab7d9e9647683,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

referring to her as  catherine  i was told in no uncertain terms that i could not refer to anyone  living or dead  by their  st names on wp if a female had a title  she had to be referred to as that throughout her article ie lady amy  or  lady dudley  for amy robsart  even though  lady amy  was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight had no title wrong after northumberland was attainted all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl a duke she did not become  lady dudley  until elizabeth i knighted robert dudley near the end of amy s life nor was she then  lady amy dudley  as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl duke i thought it was simpler to refer to her as just  amy  throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name styles  but was told it was against wp  rules though i wasn t pointed to a link for it noblewomen are usually called by their  st names round here as far as i can see  even when they have surnames are not  of  something mary boleyn is called  mary not  lady carey  or  lady stafford catherine neville is called  catherine not  the duchess of norfolk etc they re not royals  as for males  i was told they had to be referred to by their title ie leicester or last name ie dudley i was banging head on keyboard going  but no one just says  the king  all the time or refers to them as  plantagenet  or keeps changing their titles ie  henry of bolingbroke going from earl of derby to duke of hereford to duke of lancaster to king of england so how does kate get to be consistently referred to as  catherine  throughout the article  without her title appended i ve only been here a few months i would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me  as my main interest is british history i am quite confused ,0219f569a4d42602,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 words of encouragement to user damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in bulgarian nationalistic propaganda damemk  you have come to the same conclusions about bulgarian th century nationalistic propaganda on english wikipedia  user laveol is one of the most prominent editors on wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about republic of macedonia  macedonian nation history language culture sports and what else not  he is spending a lot of time working on his cause  pushing bulgarian nature in the articles of the domain of republic of macedonia  how far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at wikipedia wikiproject romacedonia where he has listed himself as a member  so just my few words of concern for the macedonian articles in english wikipedia  and the great damage done by user laveol and other users with the bulgarian and anti macedonian propaganda  hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in republic of macedonia the things will go in right direction  removing the bulgarian propaganda from macedonian articles  cleaning them of false fabricated information  and giving the facts to the world  and the views of the macedonian science and sources  i don t have much time now  but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period  i am open to any collaboration effort for the above goals i am expecting that this user laveol will continue with the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of republic of macedonia  simply because he is able to  and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda  ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the facts about the macedonia  macedonian nation history lanugage culture sports damemk  i hope you write something here  at least to show that user talk damemk and user talk ejanev is not the same user  some insight into my user name ejanev the only user i am using to contribute to wikipedia is ejanev it is composed of the first letter of my name emil and my last name janev user damemk is a separate user  probably that user name is comming from dame a macedonian first name  and mk or the code of republic of macedonia it does happen that i am from canada  i was born in republic of macedonia and have lived there until i moved to usa first and canada before more than years and yes  having all the false information from the bulgarian nationalistic propaganda originating from the th century and having it into st century to be used to negate the macedonian nation and all it s attributes by users as laveol is the reason of some of my editing actions in wikipedia  i am not the only user editor from republic of macedonia or with macedonian origin that has the same views for this bulgarian nationalistic propaganda  that already is infiltrated in the macedonian articles  you can watch the contributions of special contributions laveol and see that more than of his actions are engagement in negating the macedonian nation and its attributes  ,02443ae134f82946,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 bloc voting countries with large populations of non nationals may have their televote influenced considerably  this has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the balkan countries of the former yugoslavia this is full blown crazy  what does non nationals mean  these countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages  the stars in croatia are popular in serbia and vice versa  people are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries  there are some refugees in each of those countries  but that doesn t really explain why croatia would always give the highest no of pts to serbia  or macedonia to serbia  where there was no conflict to speak of for example  i m a bosnian serb and me voting for a croatian or a serbian song is not unusual  but i m not a bosnian non national  i have the passport of bih  and my family has never lived in serbia in history  it s really about mutual intelligibility  which is why scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time  it s the language and sensibility  ,02b0712441a1b86f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously to reiterate my original explanatoin to james  i m interested in this more on a meta level  how do we approach controversial subjects  than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards moore and his film  that is  i m trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about for an encyclopedia based around the concept of a neutral point of view  any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is  in itself  an editorial statment seems wrong  such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article see  for example  something like roe v  wade  there s no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case even if you really consider moore s movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda  and to risk the wiki equivalent of godwin s law here note that the article on triumph of the will doesn t feel the need to explain all the reasons why  nazi  germany wasn t all it was cracked up to be  similarly  shouldn t we just describe the content of the movie  noting that it is controversial and then if we want an article about the bin laden family departure or w hate ver we can put the facts about that subject there jul utc ,02df732c2dcab497,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 this is untrue i have not been  block  for the reasons mentioned but rather for entirely different reasons  since the reasons mentioned are not actually true it is impossible to exhibit a battleground attitude because of many reasons  including the fact that one cannot exhibit something unless one is a display engineer at a museum  and it would therefore be impossible to exhibit anything let alone a battleground attitude  the fact that there is no such thing as a battleground attitude  the fact that there is no such thing as an attitude in regards to how a human being acts  and the fact that the word exhibit is used in an incorrect manner here done solely for the purpose of antagonizing the user  antagonizing me usage of words like exhibit and attitude and refusing to follow the section title requirements on my page  show an obvious malfeasance intent by the above person  and therefore the block cannot be valid because within the first sentence he has already seriously demonstrated his lack of appropriate intent by specifically and purposefully being antagonizing  the second claim is physically possible  but is blatantly false i have specifically attempted to prevent other users from refusing to communicate in a appropriate manner  as he was repeatedly replying to the same conversation in several different locations  for which i reported him but yet the people at the alleged help desk refused to tell me where to report him  and even deleted several of my replies and then archived it fraudulently having other users delete my comments  participate in blatant fradulent  ism  post the same thing on multiple talk pages at once for the purpose of harassing me  etc is hardly myself making it difficult to communicate  when in fact as was just demonstrated i did the literal exact opposite of this by literally attempting to prevent other users from making it difficult to communicate  in addition  if i wish for other users to not communicate with me  i also have that right  it is in fact specifically written into law in every state in the country and will get you arrested if you fail to do so although i personally disagree with this law and it is an immoral law which deems to prevent for example ex spouses from communicating with each other when necessary  the part of the law that refers to strangers such as on wikipedia or anywhere on the internet  it is a personal choice whether you wish other strangers on the site to communicate with you or not and or post contact information etc that is why every message board in existence has an option to disable the private messaging system there were no personal attacks done by me anywhere  so this part is a baseless and fraudulent claim  refusal to abide by the site s guidelines is impossible since guidelines and rules are two different thing wikipedia does not have any rules and all policies of any kind are subject to debate and protest at any time according to the numerous wikipedia articles which specifically say this you have also demonstrated more incorrect intent by saying that something was done in multiple venues  even though no venues of any kind exist because this is a website rather then a collection of several different building which show concerts or other entertainment events and or conventions and or etc so that is also impossible  ,02ef17606e21709a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

  july utc  well  yes  that s fine  but the point here is that there is no publisher s statement made about anything in that sentence  the idea behind having a resource is that we copy what the resource says instead of just listing them as a reference  if the resource says  joe at worms then we write joe ate worms about tarnishing any reputation  that isn t the point at all  and about accepted practices in the publishing world  this is wikipedia and the accepted practices are covered by what we call policy and guidelines since those came about over a long period of time and through the process of consensus  about people keeping records of how many books were published  i think you missed the point there  publisher s weekly magazine has a statement about the number of books among other things for example  they are a secondary source  do you see how that s different about the article on fip  it hadn t any sources at all which is one of the reasons it was deleted  the only references which it had on the bottom were see also references that pointed to this article here  and other articles which were also unsourced except for pointing to this article here  fip and acim org are the same entity  facim is also the same entity  this is known  having the same board of directors  as well as sharing the same registered trademark acim etc makes anything from either of those web sites primary sources ,030782f9c3472047,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 can someone explain criticism to me this is taken from the criticisms section of the article since logic is inherently constant  and that some things are more true than others  it means that strong relativism cannot hold true under many conditions  relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another  an example of a similar phenomenon is the  gay  marriage debate in the u s an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn t apply to them  as they do not weigh up the effects of their views  can someone explain what exactly this means i do not follow the first half of the paragraph  the one that actually pertains to relativism and the example reads as complete nonsense to me  especially this part  the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn t apply to them  as they do not weigh up the effects of their views  i do not think that  a  the majority in question believes that it doesn t apply to them though i m not sure what it is in this context  so the sentence may be true the majority believes that allowing  gay  marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society  which  of course  applies to everybody in that society  b  the majority in question does not weigh up the effects of its views its views are that  gay  marriage should not be allowed  for the benefit of society  it is aware of the effects  and does not object to them  ,0323e55c8e8ab962,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

and paganism  southgate  who has a degree in theology and religious studies from canterbury university  rejected catholicism and moved towards neo pagan and heathen groups that are very loyal to the gods of the northern tradition including the odinic rite  the tribe of the wulfings and the a satru alliance  a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by valguard  mike  murray  a former member of the american  nazi  party further evidence of this  trans ition from catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with wotan  the organ of the charlemagne hammer skins southgate believed that wotan s celebration of the heroes of the norse pantheon represented the most genuine expression of european spirituality  culture and identity another key expression of this identity is exhibited by southgate s interest in the militaristic cult of mithras and the pagan spirituality of the apostate roman emperor julian ii this rejection of christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension  through the figure of christ  christianity has judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted  only the weak continue to worship a dead jew the emphasis on the judaic roots of christianity  however  is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals  sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion mithras  which was introduced into iran and india by marauding aryan tribes from the russian steppes between bce and before spreading to the roman empire  although it failed to defeat early christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century  mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers  including evola and jung  as an alternative path the west could have followed  it retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the knights templar or  latterly  himmler s ss which  the nrf claims  had its origins in various anarchist droite circles l e the black sun and the thule society  while christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the aryan psyche the awareness of europe s faustian destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu  these ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like evola and rene gue  non who discerned in them the fragments of a hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth for southgate  as for evola  tradition is an an underlying current which both permeates and  trans cends all southgate s discovery of evolian primordial tradition and his consequent rejection of catholicism as the sole cosmological truth ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene this cultural vanguard is spearheaded by a number of gothic industrial  dark ambient  black and viking metal bands  including allerseelen  blood axis  burzum  current dark holler  death in june  endura  mayhem  ostara  puissance and sol invictus  though it also encompasses more commercial bands like cradle of filth although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda  their music serves to diffuse the ideals of mithraic paganism and nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could  thus providing the perfect antidote to the spiritually enervating  multiracial values of a globalizing system southgate has also noted the potential of the straight edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers  an interesting development given  exaggerated  reports of an emerging anti anti establishment pro bush right wing punk movement although southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music orientated youth cultures  he believes a minority can be induced to take a direction basically conducive to our aims southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine synthesis  which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews this is not simply cynical manipulation  southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target  his fanzine  tribal resonance  the voice of the racial avant garde reveals southgate s strategy of linking his ideas to the common language and the big ideas of our culture through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives from without southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures  trans versally  as the  nazi s did  through a process of cultural osmosis that aims to recode the social symbology of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic  recalibrating its genetic inheritance  by creating cultural hegemony the groupuscular right believes it can forge the political space necessary for political and racial hegemony the struggle for cultural heg,0334049b60e326b8,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 ok  i ll try to sort through your latest post here  let me know if i misinterpret something  first  you specify a theory  axiomatic system namely zfc p p p omega exists let s call that t  for easy reference  now you argue that t  proves the existence of a model  let s call it m the because it s not a model of t but of a new theory such that  m  satisfies zfc p p omega  is in m now  do you mean the real p omega or do you mean that m  satisfies p omega  exists that is  that there s an element of m  that m  thinks is p omega i m guessing the latter  that m  satisfies p omega  exists you say aleph  is in the model and is less than or equal to  the cardinality of  p omega again i m guessing you mean that this is in the model s opinion  that is  m  satisfies the statement exists and ok  so going with my guesses thus far  i agree that t  proves the existence of such an m m  might be  for example  m  g where m  equals which is a model for t and g is m  generic for the partial order to add  cohen reals ,0335a9b9c5080a23,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 justin vaisse s opinion this relative absence of french american political and social unity helps to explain anti french sentiment in the united states  french historian justin va  sse has proposed that an important cause of overtly expressed public hostility toward france in the united states is the small number of americans of direct french descent http w politiqueinternationale com revue article php id revue id content  synopsis  while he acknowledges that this is not the direct cause of anti french sentiments  he argues that it explains why these sentiments can be expressed publicly  without being seen as a gross violation of political correctness  va  sse contends that by comparison  the public display of such sentiments towards other ethnic groups or nationalities would be met by strong disapproval  he proposes that as france has no powerful and organised lobby to defend it  it is socially and politically acceptable in the united states to express negative sentiments of the frenchpierre verdaguer  a turn of the century honeymoon  the washington post s coverage of france french politics  culture society  vol no summer just to answer  i ve read before that the proportion of french descendant in the us is way higher than thought because as the french colonized the new world at the same time as the brits but got outnumbered pretty quickly  they were mixed into the mainstream america  however it s true that since most of them lost traces of their heritage no lobby exists nor defends them as they don t represent or try to represent  ,033d78bf5ab10000,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 hello hi blu aardvark  glad to see you did not permanently leave wikipedia i was wondering why my template current event template redirect wasn t working  couldn t see the obvious  talk z thanks thanks for taking note of the arcata eye and plazoid pages  happy birthday  have a great day talk admin fighter that was really funny  gave me a good chuckle  you should have just crossed it out and left it in  talk removing religious and political categories  recent attempt at vote stacking leaves a bad taste in my mouth  were you referring to this  wikipedia administrators  noticeboard incidents catholic alliance of wikipedia like vote stacking no  i was referring to a wikipedia email i recieved earlier today  sent by  now  policy proposal hi  you recently commented on bible verse articles  and may therefore be interested in commenting about a proposed policy covering roughly specific verses wikipedia centralized discussion verses of kings and ubuntu logo blu i noticed you changed the logo for the ubuntu linux user box why the usage policy on ubuntu s offical site clearly allows for such use  besides  the logo is just that  a low resolution image of a logo  which is allowed under fair use i am aware that some discussion has been going around about fair use images in user boxes  if you changed the logo to tux because i labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information  i m sure i can find an appropriate image copyright tag  at the time i had changed it  several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace  per wikipedia policy  the ubuntu trademark policy may allow it  but wikipedia policy  per wp fuck is to limit images that are not available for commercial use which the ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows  talk contribs the preceding text was copied from user talk jcarroll  wp npa  please review and adhere to wp npa  wp civ  and wp wqt  please re  familliarize yourself with wikipedia policy  thanks in advance  i am fully aware of the above policies  thank you  i do not feel that it can be considered a personal attack  or incivil  to call a troll a troll  i m sorry if you don t agree with me in that but that does not mean that my statement is a violation of any of the above policies  talk contribs it is a violation  and you must refrain from it  wp npa is non negotiable  funny  nobody considers it a violation of wp npa to call user willy on wheels a vandal  nobody con,034f7ba2351c5a38,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 silesians andrew  i have not made any comments out of a desire to provoke you  i have been editing this article out of a desire to ensure it meets the standards and conventions of the english wikipedia  i am sorry you had a negative experience with the german wikipedia  but that is a separate project from this english project  assuming good faith is a fundamental principle of the english wikipedia  i advise you to give editors a chance instead of assuming the worst  i inquired about silesian polish because silesians are sometimes considered a separate ethnic group  i am not sure what you mean by reverting the article upside down my editing has been done to ensure that its formatting and style is consistent with other biographical articles  as i do not anticipate being able to copy edit the article further  i am removing it from my watchlist  good luck with the article  olessi thanks for you comments  and in fact fruitful discussion  you are right that the work of a person is most important  however  there are much present and past propaganda  which destroy the peace  if only some people would show objectivity and patience  as you did  it could be clear up  to mention nationality is however important  since exceptional individuals inspire new generation of a nation unfortunately  nations or ethnic groups will still exist  i have to hope for peaceful coexistence of them  and fair competition  seems to me that competition has to exit too best if for fun only i am conscious that english and german wikipedias are separate projects  but you see  when i approach german wiki  dzierzon article the polish relevant article was attacked by some german silesian polish guy  it cost me more then here on en wiki to settle the pl article well  so sorry if you did feel bad about my attitude  possibly i explained more my excitement with silesian is in short like this  originally  they were slavic tribe  spoke polish  as i mentioned  for some to hundred years there were under german governments  they had bad time as you possibly can imagine  many of them married with german and were are of course confused who they are  you know  the pressure on east of resilient nation and of course polish german conflicts continued  finally in poland returned and become new problem for some of the natives  even those who honestly considered himself polish silesians at the end of war could be persecuted  there in poland was complete disorder  soviets and communists arrived  most of them real simpletons any way  national government just pro soviet mafia  was mostly occupied with fight against democratic opposition  polish borders were shifted  we lost some of our area and millions of people from east territories moved to present west poland  you can imagine that most of them were not intellectuals at all  some of them completely simple people  they spoke different polish dialect also  on top of this in the post war  pro soviet atmosphere criminals found good playground  well  i do not know if you are familiar with criminal minds unfortunately i am  this is like gangrene on fresh wound  literally  thus many of the native silesian could be robber in poland  which they wanted so much  i believe that in such conditions many simpletons could use the opportunity accusing natives to be germans now  the present time  some of the falsely accused people remember the tragic experiences and want rehabilitation and apology they could be absolutely right  however  there are many germans who want their property back and some just using opportunity to stir in internal polish affairs despite the final border agreement between poland and germany signed on november and governments effort to improve relations  finaly i have to say  i beleave that polish are hospitable and very often na  ve  not many realize that politic need caution  those who realize that have a hard time to wake up the na  ves  some procentage remember lectures of history  and objectively  too many germans are toublemakers  i am also convinced there exists something like national character  you can have obviously you own opinion  let me have my own  returning to silesians it is something close to squaring the circle i wish the true silesian all the best but i do not want fith column  on polish terytory in addition sorry if i used posibly ofencive reverting the article upside down that was in the heat of the battle  wich i still have with ge wiki  they just arogantly do not answer if they do not like and refuse mediatior at any imaginative pretext  that  suck s sorry and thanks again  feel free to contact me any time you need  best regards andrew december,0362add8c95bfc0b,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 israeli palestinian conflict protect yesterday there were relevent and reliably sourced casualty figures added to the israeli palestinian conflict article  and some editors objected to this  it seems you were called in to quickly protect the page from editing  effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures  you cited edit warring  the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons  there are casualty figures in all the conflict  war  battle etc  wiki articles i have referenced  why not this one  thanks romac  the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only  which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years  this article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity  the fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself  here at wikipedia  we value the ability to achieve consensus  and to be fair to many viewpoints  and believe it or not  we often do achieve that at the article israeli palestinian conflict  it is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were reliable  without addressing any of the underlying issues  or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused  to repeat  statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article s lead  there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote  all in the name of objectivity  which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other  please note  this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus  rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus  i strongly object to your calling me disinegnuous sic you wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with hertz who argued that the statistics might be biased  do you not regard haaretz as a reliable source  please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably sourced and up to date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war  battle or conflict is disingenuous  if you or any other editor want to add more statistics  covering a longer time period  then go ahead  but do not delete relevant content added by other editors  yes  the edit sparked so much conflict and opposition but note also also that here at wikipedia we do not determine what is fair through intimidation by numbers  there is a big difference between consensus and false compromise  i apologize if you felt i was offending you in any way  i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits  not to describe you personally in any way  if other editors deleted some edits  it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so  and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article  i responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page  thanks  apology accepted  and i will also make my further comments on the article talk page  i am not a single issue editor i get around a bit on wiki  saw the haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article  i can t say i know for certain why other editors deleted the material  i try to assume good faith  we ll see  repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons motive doesn t really matter  its still edit warring  its still disruptive  protection is not an endorsement of the current version  z man  the subject of this article is a deadly conflict  the lede is huge and yet it contains no mention of the casualties  clearly  there is something seriously wrong  as a result  your action here  while well intentioned  looks highly partisan  worse than that  it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers  those who wish to cover up atrocities  the mass killings of  mostly  unarmed civilians  in many cases recognised by western sources as war crimes  if the events at this article really offend you  it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version  talk ,039412db39909ee3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 how did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject also  just because a word has a historical meaning doesn t mean that it can t ever mean anything else as culture develops  the word rap meant to knock  as on a door up until the late s for example  would you deny the more modern use of the term  the english language has no board to regulate it  as french does with the l acad  mie fran  aise  so you have no basis for defining what the word means  we have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like you re and your for example  but none such for words like bukkake  if it can be shown that it is used in a particular way  that is valid  my personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier  gay just as there is no need to call men having ass sex  gay  ass sex but that s really irrelevent  i think it is important to make clear the historical implications  but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language  even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake  splash from japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything  but specifically semen and specifically onto a person s face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it  but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it  ,039ce4c51e58b537,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 i was thinking about this last night  and came to two conclusions  first  focusing solely on this article is not the way to go  i need to go back to square one and add academic rigor  if possible  to global warming and denialism don t tell me gw is fa and is therefore academically rigorous  the fa star does not even come within discus throwing distance of establishing an article as academically rigorous second  your system of defending this wikipedia page  notice i didn t say article is completely airtight  because you hold control over all of the definitions  join any high school debate team and they ll tell you  if you own the definitions  you own the debate  and the problem here is this  you define anyone who disagrees with agw as a denialist and you define everyone who agrees with you as an expert  done  the page is impregnable  take forex the quote by democratic senator barbara boxer  using her comments as supporting evidence of the page s  not article s  thesis is a flagrant act of pov that proves this page  not article is an op ed piece from start to end  barbara boxer is a politician  every bit of power  money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only  to characterize herself as a noble public servant  and stereotype her opponents as villains  buffoons or both  even more and this is important barabara boxer is not a run of the mill politician  it would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is  in short  the boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the so what test  i intend to delete that one sometime soon too  i also wonder whether i should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank you to the editors who revert me  every time they do so  or maybe a barnstar  i dunno  some token of gratitude or other  ,03d402e88aa393f4,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

re your ae topic ban appeal  sorry  but it strains credulity  mine  anyway  to believe that you didn t realize that the adam mickiewicz article was the subject of a dispute among lithuanian and polish editors with whom you are well acquainted until the moment before you were going to hit save  as you state here recent article talk page history you haven t edited the article since and you must have  thousands of  other articles that need improvement on your watchlist  you could have posted an article edit request to the pl noticeboard  re this  as you have for many articles during the past few months in my view the a m  part of your appeal demonstrates what to call it  a lack of forthcoming ness  the remainder of the appeal  in which you speak of wp s losses from your lack of participation  that s a different story that others can think over  if you remove the a m  section i shan t contest your appeal  since lifting your topic ban now or in march doesn t make much difference in the long run  but i am concerned about that part possibly the readers will take your assertion at face value without checking the article talk page histories  you could either remove that section  since it hasn t been commented on there yet  or strike it  if you choose not to do either  i may bring it up at the ae appeal  i d prefer that we keep the conversation here  but if you d rather have it on my talk page  that s ok by me if so i ll post talkbacks ,04362e0aeafa4c45,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

deleted response to comments on wikipedia talk wikiproject ships please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia  in this particular case  the discussion was started by user brad  who made a personal comment about me  now  i dont mind this  i was more curious than offended  but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which i started on wikipedia talk naming conventions  ships you claimed that my post which you deleted was a  pov inserted into a neutral notice it may have been a pov  about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later  but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work  and thus the implicit pov that it was undesireable  it was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting if you are going to start censoring postings  then i would suggest you do so impartially you did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice  but merely removed one comment  rather than restoring impartiality  this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate far better that you do not delete anyones comments  i would suggest reading wikipedia no personal attacks  i m not sure what deleting others posts comes under  try wikipedia etiquette ,043ae7fd267f1c40,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

with respect  you seem to be mistaking references found in some online media sources to usage in a whole country  getting off the subject a little  but it does have some relevance  the nz herald routinely refers to nz ers of european descent as  pakeha where as there are plenty who find this pejorative and insulating although this attitude is softening  of course i would not include this in any article  and defintely not this one  without suitable reference lest it be deemed original research  i note it here as an example that the language of the media does not necessarily fully represent that of a country  what is very important to note is the skewed statistics of quoting the number of  hits  for rooster found in nz media  many of these hits will be refering to the australian league club sydney roosters and not the poultry  clearly rugby is of very considerable greater interest to the country s readership than poultry  just stating both  cock erel  and  rooster  are used is factual  whereas attempting to define relative usage is reliant on imprecise data  and data that is distorted towards an unrelated subject  also  i can see no value to the article in trying to rank relative usage when both  cock erel  or  rooster  are common ,046774ced4e98597,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 summary of the afd debate negative votes delete the original editor was user ivygohnair so it was marked as a vanity article for violating wp auto mapetite strong delete ignorance of the rules is not a valid argument for keeping an article  vyse neutral positive votes procedural nomination  speedy a  was applied  but was contested and this warrants a further look  i m neutral for now  even though this article doesn t seem to be colourburst comment question csd a  is unremarkable people  groups  companies and websites is that the reason for the afd too  according to wikipedia vanity guidelines as explained below  an author s conflict of interest by itself is not a basis for deletion  but lack of assertion of notability is  edward wakelin it is true that i have come into the fray to defend ivy goh nair from speedy deletion and that her last page was actually uploaded by me  i think if you want to apply the vanity label because one person edits the other and vice versa  it would only be fair to examine each case on its own merit  both user ivygohnair and user chandrannair are established figures in the field that is being discussed  ie singapore literature and writing  secondly  it should be considered in their favour that they have used their own names and not fictitious names as user names  if this had been the case  the problem wouldn t have arisen  therefore i think there is much merit in user  edward wakelin remarks above and that an author s conflict of interest is by itself not a basis for deletion  out by wikipedia  chandrannair  talk contribs comment  let s be nice to newcomers  as per wikipedia please do not bite the newcomers  this seems like a case where newcomers not knowing the rules here  an author of bestseller may be notable enough to get an article in an encyclopedia  perhaps this biography needs some fixing  as per wikipedia biographies of living persons  deleting is probably unnecessary  pfhlai i have read her book  though i m not from singapore and it s better than a lot of the stuff that makes it to the ny times best seller list  the preceding unsigned comment was added by talk contribs new to all this in wikipedia  i think the mood to delete is harsh  this is a user who seems to have made a definite impact in a small place  and is trying to popularise the creative energies of singapore  let us be more forgiving  besides it looks there is actual published reviews as testament to the work  mcporpington mcporpington sorry i meant to add to my comment above that the article should not be deleted  mcporpington mcporpington hi i am saddened to read such biting  petty comments and suggestions about deleting this article  this person has clearly contributed to singapore literature and has also been cited by others  signed phillygal i did my military service in singapore and i love the country  i vote to keep  i do not see any conflict of interest herejean louis retrieved from http en wikipedia org wiki wikipedia articles for deletion ivy goh nair ,046ad9c2995c99c3,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

tangential forces the tangential forces  coriolis and euler  can be applied to a system but they don t occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism  but that is off topic during the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that i was confused between the two we can apply a coriolis force or an euler force to a system if we like  the euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co rotating radial motion in a rotating frame of reference with non uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious euler force acting tangentially in a keplerian orbit  there will be zero tangential acceleration  although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite euler force and coriolis force having said all this  tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article  they could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force  the centrifugal force is an outward radial force more attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the  radial distance  variable they they might begin to get a feel for waht centrifugal force is all about ,04a03779ac2f339d,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

a consistent conceptualization of phylogenies  phylogenies  i e dictomously branching processes  are processes that involve things  that is  objects  and as such have to be modeled by object oriented modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects  darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects  and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects  like a sex ly reproducing cells or mitochondria now  as an object oriented model  the model actually represents two consecutive objects  i e two objects in a row  by each of its internal lines  i e lines between nodes one after a node and one before a node  the former belonging to the category  i e concept objects after nodes  and the latter to the category  objects before nodes if the model includes all objects of a certain category  then both of these make up this category  in summary  phylogenies consist of two categories  i e concepts  of objects  objects before nodes and objects after nodes  and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category  then these two categories make up this category  cladistics  or cladism as i prefer to call it  confuses the concept  objects after nodes  with the concept  objects before nodes  by defining lines between nodes as single things  thereby confusing category with object  that is kind with thing  thus confusing conceptualization itself  the approach is actually a return to a pre scientific stage  this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently  it is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate  if this approach could ever be proved to be correct  then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads  luckily  einstein s discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach  i e claim and this it did even before the approach was born  cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged consist  presently at ,04c231ddb0a06522,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

  your source states  about the black white difference in iq  which at the time was about points  the neisser et al article stated  there is not much direct evidence on this point  but what there is fails to support a genetic hypothesis  that conclusion stands today  there has been no new direct evidence on the question see rushton jensen a b  gottfredson and lynn vanhanen for the view that the black white iq difference is owing substantially to genetic differences between the races and that indirect evidence having to do with such factors as reaction time and brain size is probative  see nisbett for the view that the direct evidence indicates that thedifference between the races is entirely due to environmental factors and that the indirect evidence has little value  please stop lying then applying the same defintion to c the answer is no  do you see the problem here question c is the hereditiarian position a mainstream view the question is whether it is a widely held mainstream view that the iq test score gap is likely to be significantly explainable by genetic factors  note that the question is not whether it is the only mainstream view  nor whether it has been proven to account for the entire gap  but only about whether it is considered a probable explanation by a wide selection of mainstream scholars  yes question d is richard nisbett considered a mainstream scientist the question is whether nisbett as a person and a scholar is generally considered to be within the mainstream of the field of psychology  the question is not whether he is prominent and notable enough to be included  but about whether his views should be given equal weight to mainstream views within the article  no  nisbett holds a minority view which has been described as having  virtually no chance of being true  by a reliable tertiary source ,04c33aa8e13b949f,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 hie dvdm  i was writing what follows while you made your edit  i can t right now  but i will coming to review in detail your example  thanks johnuniq for your advice and input  concerning the actual statement  i had already thought that after clearing things up with dvdm  i would rephrase it into something in the lines of he is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late s  early s  adding to some of the generation should clear your objection about the absence of stats  but that s not the really important issue here  the fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from wikipedia to declare that the  you call it blog  site is not a reliable source here  but then find that the links and statements in inertia coupling or alexander abian are significant enriching contributions to the users of wikipedia  and the sourced site is reliable there  btw  in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned  the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis  it would be highly objectionable from wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being  and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts  the links will be trashed out  at this point the sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected it seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote  in most cases some synthesis is involved there is still the issue of the site being a reliable source  it seems to me that the wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay  is leading editors to substitute verifiability  intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority  this would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to wikipedia  once lauded as the place to come as you are  becoming stiff  purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding  this in turn carries into a discussion about public education  and the work that carl sagan is known to the general public for  cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so  to me the posts in the disputed site i linked to are interesting  but that maybe just my own personal opinion  and wikipedia users having them available is positive  constructive and enriching for wikipedia  and that s the reason i linked to them in the first place  throwing them out  all of them  seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things  the baby with the bath water  because a wikipedia directive says so  just because it does  not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening  it would seem to me  not to exclude good things by statute  so the reliable source rules are something i would like to discuss a bit more at length  ,0525305ab014194a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 firstly  some of the examples you used were from the personal attack pages maybe you should read your own posts also  the reason i decided they were inane and decided to ignore them was because they did not directly apply to what i had said perhaps they applied to the numerous inferences that you made in reference to what i said but they did not apply to what i said and meant perhaps you could try not to infer or assume what i mean and try not to take offense so easily i am respecting the basic rules of wikipedia  but i also exploited loop holes in the rules so if you want to include what i did in the rules then do so  but you should state what you want and not infer your own meaning and i m so upset because you and several other people have been complete and total  ass hole s to me and to another person who tried to post this same page you asked that we do something  i e  explain the significance of the clan  etc  and we did but you deleted it anyway and then you ask for more stuff and you give it to us also  one of the pages i read on here says that the information has to be verifiable but not the truth well what kind of bull shit  is that if this is truly an encyclopedia then dont you state the truth also  if i go and post some article some other place rather than the clans home page then i can site that and it becomes verifiable right if you say no  then this is just another example of something that is not explicitly stated and a loop hole that people can exploit before you go around messing with other peoples posts maybe you could get your rules and priorities straight ,05342a65eab40629,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 elelland  hello humus  i am sorry if i have placed this note in the wrong spot  i m very inexperienced with wikipedia  i was enthralled by wikipedia  initially  that is until i met eleland  i noticed that you had some interesting discussions with eleland  eleland engineered a small article which i contributed some information to be deleted  he organised a kangaroo court made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus the article was on ed o loughlin fairfax publishing mideast correspondent  the said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary  he was amongst the candidates for this year s hr com dishonest reporter award despite being in the australia only catchment area so you can imagine the quality of his journalism anyway eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted so i studied eleland a little i ve looked at over of his posts on the arab israel conflict  more than were directly anti israel  his modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro israel side  in this way he has undermined many many articles personally i don t care what his opinion is  but when he uses his editorial power and influence at wikipedia to falsely invalidate  delete  manipulate etc  i think there is a problem wikipedia is  i am afraid  beginning to read like eleland wrote the script who is eleland  what power does he actually have can anything be done adon emmet  if you post a reply here i will contact here or even by e mail ,053820f28e2f3b8a,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 misleading reference to study in the section on lead paint in art  which i largely wrote someone added the following lead paint will often become discolored over long periods of time  this is due to the reaction of the lead carbonate in the paint with traces of hydrogen sulfide in the air and with acids  often from fingerprints as a result  many older works of art that used lead paint now show some discoloration  as i found this surprising  i went and carefully read the study being cited  their research seemed to refer only to lead in aqueous media on paper  although that wasn t absolutely clear  but lead paint is almost never used that way  artists working in  trans parent watercolor  aquarelle  don t usually use white paint  or just occasionally a bit of chinese white not lead  to make corrections  and opaque watercolors  gouache  and acrylic  polymer  artist s paints typically use titanium dioxide or  rarely  zinc white  but never lead  normally flake white is used only by oil painters  and there s no indication in the study that they were referring to oil paints  cooperstown is a well respected institution  but as of now i m sticking with the classic  ralph mayer flake white may get  slightly  yellowish after centuries  but nothing like the gross discoloration referred to in the paragraph above  if someone has more information on this  please mention it here  otherwise when i come back i m going to delete that paragraph or water it down  no pun intended ,054f92b9b3674bf2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 addressing  while indian tribe is official us gov t lingo  saying tribe twice in the first sentence and then again in the second is awkward  also the tribe is not a monolithic entity  but rather a collection of people so maybe reword to say something like the coeur d alene people once inhabited acres ha  in northern idaho and washington and montana  actually  note article on the tribe  but today  the only land controlled by the tribal nation is the coeur d alene reservation in benewah and kootenai counties  idaho you don t have to use my wording  but you see how i am distinguishing land and people  though the two are  of course  closely intertwined boomer  second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit  i d put right up front that johnson did the executive order but congress never acted on it  then go on about how the tribe didn t accept it anyway keep the chronology clearer  interesting that the coeur d alene article says nothing about this period  maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too  hm from a very cursory review of the decision  it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and idaho s statehood becomes significant in this case  so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact  but it s something that s going to matter  the section fails to draw out the significance of the info on the state park and mining  maybe add a wee bit to hint at why this will matter in the scotus case  ,05586b54dbe78f09,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 pseudonymous editing copied from an email received offline hi i m not quite sure how this works  but your wrote in my deletion review  you say that your name and address are available  but your contributions to wikipedia are pseudonymous  does this mean i hadn t registered  i did so last night  and not under a pseudonym as most people have  i always use my real name in signatures and i don t know how to post to your talk page because there appears to be no post link thanks  dennis bathory kitsz bathory bathory org bathory maltedmedia com  thanks for your message but i think perhaps my meaning was still unclear whether you register or not doesn t really matter since anyone can register under any name i could go online and register a wikipedia account as george w  bush  at least  if it s not already taken wikipedia has no means to authenticate your identity independently all that we know all that we can know is what you choose to claim about yourself  that s what i meant by pseudonymously any registration  even if you say that it s your real name  is technically a pseudonym it is not independently verified against some external identity database and for the most part  that works out very well on wikipedia we want users and editors to establish themselves through their actions and to demonstrate their expertise through their edits  not by making claims to outside credentials by the way  anyone could also register as dennis bathory kitzs that trivial misspelling would be easily overlooked by readers but would still be accepted by the system such a person could sign their name the same way you do  attempt to mimic your pattern of speech  well  writing really  and make subtle edits just to discredit you that  in fact  is a real problem for established editors of wikipedia when we find usernames that are suspiciously similar to established users  we look very carefully for signs of vandalism or deceit users who appear to have done something like that on purpose are generally banned from wikipedia but those are all manual checks there is no system that can automatically detect or prevent it likewise  no one can inherently trust the email address the way internet domains are set up  anyone could register bathory org and create any email name they wanted like wikipedia accounts  emails and internet domains are unverified against any external identity authority and that s before you consider the problems of email spoofing and forgery both of which are far easier and common today than any of us would like to admit most people are honest but there are enough dishonest people out there that we have to build our systems and our procedures in such a way that it doesn t matter whether they are telling the truth about their identity or not that s why wikipedia has a policy against original research  which we mean as a contribution or assertion based on personal experience and why we never rely solely on self published materials and why we bias our policy so strongly in favor of reliable sources such as websites owned by and operated by large  well known organizations organizations with both a vested interest in and the resources to find and stop spoofing sorry to bore you with all this but my non wikipedia profession is information security the inherent problems of identity management and authentication occupy much of my waking hours how can a bank know that you re really you and how far can that trust be extended under what conditions can an assertion be treated as reliable how do we balance that against the need to make systems and computers easy and accessible unfortunately  there are no easy answers short of establishing a national identity database something which would be in great tension with my role as a privacy advocate  anyway  i ll get off my soapbox now thanks for your message to post to my talk page  just go to the page and edit it like you would edit any page on wikipedia the most common technique is to use the little plus sign next to the edit this page tab at the top that will automatically create a new section and give you a line to create a section header without having to know the wiki markup symbols you should also get in the habit of signing your posts on talk pages you can do that easily by ending your comment with four tildes when you save the page  the mediawiki software will replace the tildes with your username and the date timestamp again  welcome to wikipedia  talk ,055c9cafcdb359f9,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

  quoting from the article rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered  in part because she dressed in expensive clothing which served to alienate her from those suffering the privations caused by the war  and windsor castle  about miles kilometres  west of central london so  the views that you express are already represented in the article  it seems fair and well balanced to me  making it critical is not what wikipedia is about  we should not be a platform for political views  but an encyclopedia presenting facts  ,0565fcebf5b16273,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

 the ctmu is not passing itself off as an academic theory  it can t  because langan is not a member of academia  but then again  a theory need not be academic to be notable  for example  print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well  nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness  scholarly integrity  or intellectual merit  except possibly in the well indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves  and of course  their aspiring apprentices  whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions byrgenwulf complains that we chaps are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article  this is correct  to his credit  he invites others to tag his assertions  however  this is a bit specious  for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant  verifiable assertions to make  he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others  thus  we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of langan s assertions receive a separate citation  when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article  it is important for byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents  not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article  but given that the article already links to ample source material  anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false  irrelevant  or non neutral  unfortunately  he hasn t yet been able to lock onto this signal  he still labors under the assumption that like some sort of ultimate bureaucrat  he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself  by now  everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization  neither byrgenwulf  nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates  has any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations  they are merely using the article  which is faithful to the material it cites  to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic  the ctmu  which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks  they do not like what the ctmu says  the article on the ctmu reports on what the ctmu says  and what langan and the press say about the ctmu  hence  they do not like the article on the ctmu  this conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in byrgenwulf s  trans parent strategy of attacking the theory through the article  attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger  meanwhile  he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of wikipedia verifiability policy  and that his all too evident editorial bias is in massive violation of npov as well  oozing contempt  byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the ctmu article with a load of summary demands  snide remarks  and self righteous  factually worthless criticism but not one relevant citation in hand  nothing he says is verifiable  as we have now repeatedly seen  he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert  this makes it very difficult  if not impossible  to take his demands seriously  ,05687bcb86751fc2,0.0,0.0,0.0,train,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
